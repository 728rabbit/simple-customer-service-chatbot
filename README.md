This is a simple yet elegant **web-based customer service chat system**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input queries such as "hours", "returns", etc., and the system will match the input with a predefined set of synonyms and respond accordingly:

1.  **Exact match** → Directly replies with the corresponding answer.
    
2.  **Partial match with multiple items** → Offers options for the user to choose from.
    
3.  **Partial match with a single item** → Automatically replies with the answer.
    
4.  **No match found** → Displays a "Sorry, no answer found" message.
    

The overall design is modern, with clear message bubbles and highlighted options, making it suitable for use as a prototype for small to medium-sized business online customer support or for educational purposes.
